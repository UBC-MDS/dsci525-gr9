# Australian Rainfall Prediction

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and deploy ensemble machine learning models to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB). The dataset includes features that are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation. The purpose of this project is to provide exposure to working with much larger datasets than what we have previously encountered. 

This project will be completed in four milestones, with the ultimate goal of having a deployed machine learning model in the cloud for others to use. This project will provides valuable experience in building and deploying machine learning models, as well as working collaboratively in a team environment using cloud services.
