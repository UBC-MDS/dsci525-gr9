    "Once your API (the question above is done) we're ready to deploy it! For this, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup an EC2 instance. Make sure you add a rule in security group (of your EC2 instance) to accept `All TCP` connections from `Anywhere`. After that SSH into your EC2 instance.\n",
    "2. Make a file `app.py` file in your instance and copy what you developed in Question 1 in there. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1 You can use the Linux editor using ```vi```. More details on vi Editor [here](https://www.guru99.com/the-vi-editor.html). Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc. You can copy code from your jupyter and paste it into `app.py`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 (OPTIONAL WAY) Or else you can make a file in your laptop called app.py and copy it over to your EC2 instance using ```scp```. Eg: ```scp -r -i \"ggeorgeAD.pem\" ~/Desktop/app.py  ubuntu@ec2-xxx.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download your model from s3 to your EC2 instance. You want to configure your AWS CLI and S3 for this. Use your previous learnings, notes, mini videos, etc.\n",

    "        - Install packages (there might be others): \n",
    "            pip install flask scikit-learn joblib\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now you're ready to start your service, go ahead and run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080`. This will make your service available at your EC2 instance's `Public IPv4 address` on port 8080. Please ensure that you run this from where ```app.py``` and ```model.joblib``` reside.\n",
    "6. You can now access your service by typing your EC2 instances `public IPv4 address` append with `:8080` into a browser, so something like `http://Public IPv4 address:8080`. From step 4, you might notice that flask output saying \"Running on http://XXXX:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\", where XXXX is `Private IPv4 address`, and you want to replace it with the `Public IPv4 address`\n",
    "7. You should use `curl` to send a post request to your service to make sure it's working as expected.\n",
    ">EG: curl -X POST http://your_EC2_public_ip:8080/predict -d '{\"data\":[1,2,3,4,53,11,22,37,41,53,11,24,31,44,53,11,22,35,42,53,12,23,31,42,53]}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Now, what happens if you exit your connection with the EC2 instance? Can you still reach your service? You won't be able to, because the `flask` process will shut down when you exit your shell session. This is because `flask` is running in the foreground, and when you exit your shell session, the process is killed. We need to run `flask` in the background so that it persists even after we exit our shell session.\n",
    "9. We could use several options to help us persist our server even after we exit our shell session. We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try reaccessing your service with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "Overall, we learned quite a lot about what cloud computing is, how to use it and how it can help data scientists perform tasks when involving big data. At the start of this course not many of our group members had much experience with cloud computing but after completing milestone 4, we still may not be experts in cloud computing but now we can move forth feeling a bit more familiarized with the concept. Here are some points that we learned on our journey through milestone 1 to 4:\n",

    "4. S3 is a storage service for your data on AWS and S3 buckets can be made by individuals that are not the creators of the EC2 instance\n",
